# Weather Crisis Resource Allocation System

This project provides an algorithm-driven system that allocates limited emergency supplies to crisis-affected regions during severe weather events.

The backend includes:
- Greedy allocation
- Knapsack DP optimization
- Max-flow (network capacity routing)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (routing efficiency)

The frontend is a simple React interface that sends user inputs to the backend and displays the allocation results.

## How to Run
run pip install flask flask-cors
then run python app.py
